    <h1>Java</h1>
    <p style="font-weight: bolder;line-height: normal;font-size: xx-large;">Java is a high-level, class-based,
        object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation
        dependencies as possible. It was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. Java's
        primary
        goal is to enable developers to write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all
        platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.</p>

    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">The Java Platform is a collection of programs that help
        developers create and run Java applications efficiently.
        It includes an execution engine, a compiler, and a set of libraries Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur
