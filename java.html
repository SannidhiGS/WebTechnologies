            <b><i>Literals</i></b>
            <p>There are four kinds of literals: string, numeric, Boolean, and enum.<br>

                <mark>String literals: </mark>A string literal is enclosed in single quotes:<br>

                'Duke'<br>
                If a string literal contains a single quote, you indicate the quote by using two single quotes:<br>

                'Duke''s'<br>
                Like a Java String, a string literal in the query language uses the Unicode character encoding.<br>

                <mark>Numeric literals:</mark> There are two types of numeric literals: exact and approximate.<br>

                An exact numeric literal is a numeric value without a decimal point, such as 65, –233, and +12. Using
                the Java integer syntax, exact numeric literals support numbers in the range of a Java long.<br>

                An approximate numeric literal is a numeric value in scientific notation, such as 57., –85.7, and +2.1.
                Using the syntax of the Java floating-point literal, approximate numeric literals support numbers in the
                range of a Java double.<br>

                <mark>Boolean literals: </mark>A Boolean literal is either TRUE or FALSE. These keywords are not
                case-sensitive.<br>

                <mark>Enum literals:</mark> The Java Persistence query language supports the use of enum literals using
                the Java enum literal syntax. The enum class name must be specified as a fully qualified class name:<br>

                SELECT e<br>
                FROM Employee e<br>
                WHERE e.status = com.xyz.EmployeeStatus.FULL_TIME
            </p><br>

            <b><i>Keywords</i></b>
            <p>Here is a list of keywords in the Java programming language. You cannot use any of the following as
                identifiers in your programs. The keywords const and goto are reserved, even though they are not
                currently used. true, false, and null might seem like keywords, but they are actually literals; you
                cannot use them as identifiers in your programs.
            </p>

            <b><i>Array</i></b>
            <p>An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.</p>
            <b>Methods</b>
            <p>In Java, methods are blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks. They are part of a class and
                define the behavior of objects. Methods allow you to organize and reuse code efficiently, improving
                readability and reducing redundancy.

                Key Components of a Method:<br>
                Modifiers: Define the access level (e.g., public, private) or behavior (e.g., static, final) of the
                method.<br>
                Return Type: Specifies the type of value the method returns (e.g., int, void if no value is
                returned).<br>
                Method Name: A unique identifier for the method, following Java naming conventions.<br>
                Parameters: Optional inputs passed to the method, enclosed in parentheses.<br>
                Method Body: The block of code enclosed in braces {} that defines the actions performed by the
                method.<br>
                Example:<br>
                Copy the code<br>
                public class Example {<br>
                // A simple method to add two numbers<br>
                public int addNumbers(int a, int b) {<br>
                return a + b; // Returns the sum of a and b<br>
                }<br>

                public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
                Example obj = new Example();<br>
                int result = obj.addNumbers(5, 10);<br>
                System.out.println("Sum: " + result); // Output: Sum: 15<br>
                }
                }

                Why Use Methods?<br>
                Code Reusability: Write once, use multiple times.<br>
                Modularity: Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces.<br>
                Readability: Makes the code easier to understand and maintain.<br>

                For more details, you can explore the Oracle Java Documentation.</p>
            <b>Operators</b>
            <p>Operators are special symbols that perform specific operations on one, two, or three operands, and then
                return a result. As we explore the operators of the Java programming language, it may be helpful for you
                to know ahead of time which operators have the highest precedence.</p>
            <b><i>looping techniques</i></b>
            <p>The statements inside your source files are generally executed from top to bottom, in the order that they
                appear. Control flow statements, however, break up the flow of execution by employing decision making,
                looping, and branching, enabling your program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code. This
                section describes the decision-making statements (if-then, if-then-else, switch), the looping statements
                (for, while, do-while), and the branching statements (break, continue, return) supported by the Java
                programming language.</p>
